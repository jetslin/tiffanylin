                I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. For my first co-op work term,
                I worked at ADLINK Technology Inc in Taipei, Taiwan where I worked in a team of 4 to develop
                the user interface and back-end Python and C++ modules for an edga data analytics software to 
                detect physical devices, while processing and calculating analog input/output and digital input/output.
                I'm really excited to bring my knowledge and 
                skills to new workplaces! For my second work term, I worked at a startup company called AutoMetrics
                Manufacturing Technologies Inc. I focused on researching about machine learning models
                that can be used in the company's main product, Inspection 4.0. I had a rare opportunity to develop and 
                integrate an anomaly detection model in the software with a months worth of thorough research and testing.
                I also gained the experience of training a model for semantic segmentation. All of this was a great
                learning opporunity! This is my

                I enjoy making projects that interests me or helps me out with my daily life. My friends and I 
                worked on <a href="https://github.com/OliviaLiu200/Tick" target="_blank" class="aboutme__link">Tick</a>, 
                a chrome extension that keeps track of the user's time spend on each URL on
                the Chrome browser. It was really fun! As an anime lover, I recently built an anime database, 
                <a href="https://jetslin.github.io/aniBase1.1/" target="_blank" class="aboutme__link">aniBase</a>,
                so that I can search for all the anime I love! New functions are still being worked on, so stay tuned!
                I also created a game called 
                <a href="https://github.com/Rebecca1223/BiQuadris" target="_blank" class="aboutme__link">BiQuadris</a>, 
                a Tetris clone with special rulesets for an OOP course at the University of Waterloo. I worked in a team
                of 3, earning a final grade of 97%! I was responsible for handling the input, score, and creation of the 
                blocks, as well as the main communication between the model, view, and controller of the game! 
                Currently, I'm also working on a Youtube to MP4
                converter that is designed for convenient converting of large amounts of Youtube footage.
                As one who enjoys editing music videos during my free time, this would make my life a lot
                easier!

                During my free time, I'll either be playing sports, catching up on the newest anime, or editing
                music videos.
