                I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. This is my 
                <a href="current/Resume_TiffanyLin_20251107.pdf" target="_blank" class="aboutme__link">resume</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy making projects that interests me or helps me out with my daily life. My friends and I 
                worked on <a href="https://github.com/OliviaLiu200/Tick" target="_blank" class="aboutme__link">Tick</a>, 
                a chrome extension that keeps track of the user's time spend on each URL on
                the Chrome browser. It was really fun! As an anime lover, I recently built an anime database, 
                <a href="https://jetslin.github.io/aniBase1.1/" target="_blank" class="aboutme__link">aniBase</a>,
                so that I can search for all the anime I love! New functions are still being worked on, so stay tuned!
                I also created a game called 
                <a href="https://github.com/Rebecca1223/BiQuadris" target="_blank" class="aboutme__link">BiQuadris</a>, 
                a Tetris clone with special rulesets for an OOP course at the University of Waterloo. I worked in a team
                of 3, earning a final grade of 97%! I was responsible for handling the input, score, and creation of the 
                blocks, as well as the main communication between the model, view, and controller of the game! 
            </p>
            <p>
                During my free time, I'll either be playing sports, catching up on the newest anime, or editing
                music videos!

            <p>
                For my first co-op work term,
                I worked at ADLINK Technology Inc in Taipei, Taiwan where I worked in a team of 4 to develop
                the user interface and back-end Python and C++ modules for an edga data analytics software to 
                detect physical devices, while processing and calculating analog input/output and digital input/output.
                I'm really excited to bring my knowledge and 
                skills to new workplaces! For my second work term, I worked at a startup company called AutoMetrics
                Manufacturing Technologies Inc. I focused on researching about machine learning models
                that can be used in the company's main product, Inspection 4.0. I had a rare opportunity to develop and 
                integrate an anomaly detection model in the software with a months worth of thorough research and testing.
                I also gained the experience of training a model for semantic segmentation. All of this was a great
                learning opportunity!
            </p>
            <p>
                For the remainder of my work terms, I worked at Huawei, where I learned a great deal and formed meaningful
                connections with my colleagues. During my first 8 months, I collaborated with multiple teams—starting with
                developing an ArkTS auditor, then moving on to audio and signal processing, then finally joining a team focused
                on computer vision. With this team, we successfully developed and launched the 
                <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/phones/nova13/" target="_blank" class="aboutme__link">'AI Best Expression'</a> 
                feature on Huawei Nova 13.
                Through this project, I gained valuable experience across the entire product development process—from the initial research
                and slow prototyping stages to the fast-paced delivery phase where we held regular meetings with our partner team
                at headquarters in China. When I returned to Huawei for my final 8 month co-op term, I rejoined the same time to work 
                on a new deliverable involving SOTA image generation models like Stable Diffusion XL. Along the way, I deepened my understanding
                of related concepts including LoRAs, ControlNets, and reinforcement learning, even integrating a reward-based model intro
                our pipeline. In addition to our main project, our team explored potential research opportunities, giving me firsthand
                experience with the research process. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Huawei and truly value the technical and
                professional growth I achieved through these experiences.
